# Mandelbrot Explorer

Installation Instructions:
1. If your system doesn't have Python installed, install Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Navigate to your Python "Lib" folder and add graphics.py to it
3. The Mandelbrot and Julia set explorer is ready to run

Instructions to Run and Use:
1. Open any Python IDE, shell will work
2. Run MandalapuSME.py
3. To use the Mandelbrot Explorer:
  a. Pick a color scheme
  b. Max iterations and step size don't need to be changed, the program is not optimized and changing these might make the image less accurate or increase run time.
  c. Select w/o Escaping to see only the Mandelbrot set without escape radii (this will be faster but simpler) or w/ Escaping for a more interesting image that includes escape radii (a more traditional image of the Mandelbrot Set).
  d. Once you are satisfied with your selections, click "Graph It" and a graph window will open, give it some time to display the image. The program is not optomized and graphing the Mandelbrot set require numerous calculations.
  e. To zoom into a certain section, click any two places on the window. The program will display a box with corners located at the two clicks, if you are satisfied with your selection click "yes" or click "no" to try again. 
  f. Once you click yes the original Mandelbrot prompt will be displayed, select either w/o escaping or w/ escaping and click "Graph It" again.
  g. Repeat this process as many times as you want, the program can be closed from the zoom prompt.
4. To use the Julia Set Explorer
  a. From the window that opens when the program is run, select a color scheme and click the Julia Set button. 
  b. Again, maximum iterations and step size need not be changed, but can be changed if you would like.
  c. Play with the values of the Real and Complex values some values to try can be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set
  d. Select Two Tone, Inverse, or Exterior. Two Tone runs faster but is less interesting, Exterior includes escaping values making a beautiful image, and Inverse graphs the inverse function in two tones.
  e. The zoom works the same way as that in the Mandelbrot Explorer and the program can be exited the same way as well.
